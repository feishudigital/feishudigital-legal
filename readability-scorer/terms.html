    <h2>2. Service description</h2>
    <p>Readability Scorer is a Chrome browser extension that provides real-time readability analysis for text fields on any website. It computes readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Coleman-Liau, SMOG, ARI, Dale-Chall) and detects writing issues (passive voice, adverbs, complex words, clich&eacute;s, hedge words, sentence repetition). It also offers inline highlighting of issues via the CSS Custom Highlight API, writing goals with daily word count and streak tracking, and sentence-level analysis. All analysis is performed entirely in your browser. We do not operate a backend server and do not have access to your text or data.</p>

    <h2>3. Free and Pro plans</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Free plan:</strong> Up to 5 analyses per day. Flesch Reading Ease score, basic statistics (word count, sentence count, reading time, grade level).</li>
      <li><strong>Pro plan (&euro;4.99/month):</strong> Unlimited analyses, all 7 readability formulas, passive voice detection, adverb detection, complex word detection (with simpler alternatives), clich&eacute; detection, hedge word detection, sentence repetition detection, sentence-level analysis, inline highlighting (CSS Custom Highlight API), and writing goals (daily word count and streak tracking).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prices may change with 30 days notice. Existing subscribers keep their current price until the end of their billing cycle.</p>

    <h2>4. Payments and billing</h2>
    <p>Payments are processed by <strong>Lemon Squeezy</strong> (Lemon Squeezy, LLC), who acts as Merchant of Record. Lemon Squeezy handles all billing, taxes, VAT, invoicing, and refund processing. By subscribing to a Pro plan, you also agree to <a href="https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/terms" target="_blank">Lemon Squeezy's Terms of Service</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subscriptions are billed monthly and renew automatically</li>
      <li>You can cancel at any time — access continues until the end of the current billing period</li>
      <li>Refund requests are handled by Lemon Squeezy — contact us within 14 days of purchase</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Right of withdrawal (Widerrufsrecht)</h2>
    <div class="warning">
      <strong>Widerrufsbelehrung:</strong> As a consumer in the EU, you have the right to withdraw from the purchase within 14 days without giving a reason.
    </div>
    <p>The withdrawal period is 14 days from the date of purchase. To exercise your right of withdrawal, contact us at <strong>feishudigital@gmail.com</strong> with a clear statement of your decision to withdraw.</p>
    <p><strong>Early expiration of the right of withdrawal:</strong> By activating your Pro license key in the extension, you expressly consent to the immediate provision of the digital content and acknowledge that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal (Art. 16(m) Directive 2011/83/EU, &sect; 356(5) BGB). If you do not activate your license key, the 14-day withdrawal period applies in full.</p>
    <p>To process a withdrawal/refund, contact us at feishudigital@gmail.com or directly through your Lemon Squeezy account.</p>

    <h2>6. License activation</h2>
    <p>Pro features are unlocked via a license key provided by email after purchase. Each license key is valid for one user. The extension validates the license key periodically (approximately once per day) via the Lemon Squeezy API. Sharing license keys or circumventing license validation is not permitted.</p>

    <h2>7. Acceptable use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, modify, or redistribute the extension</li>
      <li>Circumvent license validation or free-tier limits</li>
      <li>Use the extension for any illegal purpose</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Accuracy of analysis</h2>
    <p>Readability scores and writing suggestions are computed using established formulas and heuristic algorithms. They are intended as writing aids and should not be treated as definitive assessments of text quality. Syllable counting, passive voice detection, and other analyses are approximations (~90% accuracy) and may produce occasional false positives or negatives. The extension does not replace professional editing or proofreading.</p>

    <h2>9. Data and privacy</h2>
    <p>Your text is never stored or transmitted. All analysis happens in your browser's memory and is discarded after display. Settings are stored locally in your browser. We do not operate a backend server and do not have access to your data. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>

    <h2>10. Service availability and updates</h2>
    <p>The extension runs entirely in your browser and does not depend on external servers for its core functionality. However, browser updates may affect compatibility. We strive to maintain compatibility with current Chrome versions but cannot guarantee uninterrupted service. We may release updates at any time to fix issues or add features.</p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>Readability Scorer is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of or inability to use the extension</li>
      <li>We are not liable for writing decisions made based on the extension's analysis or suggestions</li>
      <li>Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid for the Pro subscription in the 12 months preceding the claim</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These limitations do not apply to liability for intentional misconduct (<em>Vorsatz</em>) or gross negligence (<em>grobe Fahrl&auml;ssigkeit</em>), or to any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law (including mandatory consumer protection rights under EU law).</p>

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may revoke license keys if these terms are violated. You may stop using the extension at any time by uninstalling it. Uninstalling removes all local data immediately.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to these terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via the Chrome Web Store listing or extension update notes. Continued use after being notified of changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. If you do not agree with changes, you may uninstall the extension.</p>

    <h2>14. Online dispute resolution</h2>
    <p>The European Commission provides an Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform for consumers: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>. We are not obligated and not willing to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board, but we are always open to resolving issues directly — contact us at feishudigital@gmail.com.</p>

    <h2>15. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect.</p>

    <h2>16. Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. If you are a consumer residing in the EU, you additionally benefit from any mandatory provisions of the consumer protection laws of your country of residence. Place of jurisdiction for all disputes is Hamburg, Germany, unless mandatory consumer protection laws provide for a different jurisdiction.</p>
