    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.</p>

    <div class="warning">
      <strong>Widerrufsbelehrung:</strong> As a consumer in the EU, you have the right to withdraw from the purchase within 14 days without giving a reason.
    </div>
    <p>The withdrawal period is 14 days from the date of purchase. To exercise your right of withdrawal, contact us at <strong>feishudigital@gmail.com</strong> with a clear statement of your decision to withdraw.</p>
    <p><strong>Early expiration of the right of withdrawal:</strong> By using Pro features after subscribing, you expressly consent to the immediate provision of the digital service and acknowledge that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal (Art. 16(m) Directive 2011/83/EU, § 356(5) BGB). If you do not use Pro features, the 14-day withdrawal period applies in full.</p>

    <h2>7. Acceptable use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, modify, or redistribute the extension or backend</li>
      <li>Circumvent free-tier usage limits or rate limiting</li>
      <li>Use automated tools to access the BayScout API outside of the extension</li>
      <li>Use BayScout in ways that violate eBay's terms of service or applicable law</li>
      <li>Resell, sublicense, or share account access with third parties</li>
      <li>Use the service for any illegal purpose</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. eBay data and compliance</h2>
    <p>BayScout accesses publicly visible eBay data through official eBay APIs and page content. We comply with eBay's API License Agreement and Developer Program policies. The data displayed in BayScout (prices, listings, seller info) originates from eBay and may not be perfectly accurate or up-to-date. We make no guarantees about the accuracy of eBay marketplace data.</p>

    <h2>9. Alert notifications</h2>
    <p>BayScout sends email notifications when your configured alerts trigger (e.g., price drops, seller activity). By creating alerts, you consent to receiving these emails at your registered email address. You can disable individual alerts or all email notifications at any time through the dashboard.</p>

    <h2>10. AI features (future)</h2>
    <p>BayScout may include AI-powered features (listing optimization, keyword suggestions) in the future. When activated, listing data you submit may be processed by third-party AI providers (OpenAI or Anthropic). AI-generated content is provided as suggestions only — you are responsible for reviewing and editing any AI output before using it on eBay.</p>

    <h2>11. Data and privacy</h2>
    <p>Your account data, tracking data, and alert configurations are stored on our servers (Supabase database, Fly.io infrastructure). See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full details on data processing, storage, third-party services, and your rights under GDPR.</p>

    <h2>12. Service availability</h2>
    <p>We strive to maintain high availability but cannot guarantee uninterrupted service. BayScout may experience downtime due to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Server maintenance or updates</li>
      <li>Changes to eBay's website structure or APIs</li>
      <li>Third-party service outages (Supabase, eBay, Lemon Squeezy)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are not liable for temporary unavailability. We will make reasonable efforts to restore service promptly.</p>

    <h2>13. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>BayScout is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of or inability to use the service</li>
      <li>We are not liable for decisions you make based on data displayed by BayScout (pricing decisions, inventory choices, etc.)</li>
      <li>We are not liable for data loss resulting from service disruption, account termination, or third-party service failures</li>
      <li>Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid for the Pro subscription in the 12 months preceding the claim</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These limitations do <strong>not</strong> apply to liability for intentional misconduct or gross negligence, or to any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law (including mandatory consumer protection rights under EU law).</p>

    <h2>14. Termination</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may stop using BayScout at any time by uninstalling the extension and cancelling your subscription</li>
      <li>You can request account deletion by contacting feishudigital@gmail.com</li>
      <li>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms, with notice where possible</li>
      <li>Upon termination, your server-side data will be deleted within 30 days (unless required by law to retain)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>15. Changes to these terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via the Chrome Web Store listing, extension update notes, or email to registered users. Continued use after being notified of changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. If you do not agree with changes, you may cancel your subscription and uninstall the extension.</p>

    <h2>16. Online dispute resolution</h2>
    <p>The European Commission provides an Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform for consumers: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>. We are not obligated and not willing to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board, but we are always open to resolving issues directly — contact us at feishudigital@gmail.com.</p>

    <h2>17. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect.</p>

    <h2>18. Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. If you are a consumer residing in the EU, you additionally benefit from any mandatory provisions of the consumer protection laws of your country of residence. Place of jurisdiction for all disputes is Hamburg, Germany, unless mandatory consumer protection laws provide for a different jurisdiction.</p>
