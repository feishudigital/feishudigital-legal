    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">AI Chat Organizer — Chrome Extension — Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      By installing or using AI Chat Organizer, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, please uninstall the extension.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Service description</h2>
    <p>AI Chat Organizer is a Chrome browser extension that adds folders, tags, search, prompts, and export functionality to AI chat platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini). It operates entirely within your browser and does not provide a backend service.</p>

    <h2>2. Free and Pro plans</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Free plan:</strong> Limited folders, basic search, sort, and markdown export.</li>
      <li><strong>Pro plan ($4.99/month):</strong> Unlimited folders, tags, JSON export, and all current and future premium features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prices may change with 30 days notice. Existing subscribers keep their current price until the end of their billing cycle.</p>

    <h2>3. Payments and billing</h2>
    <p>Payments are processed by <strong>Lemon Squeezy</strong>, who acts as Merchant of Record. Lemon Squeezy handles all billing, taxes, VAT, and refunds. By subscribing to a Pro plan, you also agree to <a href="https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/terms" target="_blank">Lemon Squeezy's Terms of Service</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subscriptions are billed monthly and renew automatically</li>
      <li>You can cancel at any time — access continues until the end of the billing period</li>
      <li>Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis — contact us within 14 days of purchase</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. License activation</h2>
    <p>Pro features are unlocked via a license key provided after purchase. Each license key is valid for one user. Sharing license keys or circumventing license validation is not permitted.</p>

    <h2>5. Acceptable use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, modify, or redistribute the extension</li>
      <li>Circumvent license validation or free-tier limits</li>
      <li>Use the extension in ways that violate the terms of service of ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini</li>
      <li>Use the extension for any illegal purpose</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Platform relationship</h2>
    <p>AI Chat Organizer is an independent third-party tool. We are <strong>not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google</strong>. ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are trademarks of their respective owners. The extension reads publicly visible sidebar data from these platforms.</p>

    <h2>7. Data and privacy</h2>
    <p>All your data (folders, tags, prompts, settings) is stored locally in your browser. We do not operate a backend server and do not have access to your data. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

    <h2>8. Service availability</h2>
    <p>The extension depends on the DOM structure of third-party platforms. If ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini change their website structure, some features may temporarily stop working until we release an update. We strive to maintain compatibility but cannot guarantee uninterrupted service.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>AI Chat Organizer is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the extension, including but not limited to data loss or inability to access features.</p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may revoke license keys if these terms are violated. You may stop using the extension at any time by uninstalling it. Uninstalling removes all local data.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to these terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Material changes will be noted in the Chrome Web Store listing. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing law</h2>
    <p>These terms are governed by the laws of Germany. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Germany.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact</h2>
